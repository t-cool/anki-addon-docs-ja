This document contains some hints to get you started, but it is not a
comprehensive guide. To actually write an add-on, you will need to
familiarize yourself with Ankiâ€™s source code, and the source code of
other add-ons that do similiar things to what you are trying to
accomplish.

Because of our limited resources, **no official support is available for
add-on writing**. If you have any questions, you will either need to
find the answers yourself in the source code, or post your questions on
the [development forum](https://forums.ankiweb.net/c/development/12).

You can also use the add-on forum to request someone write an add-on for
you. You may need to offer some money before anyone becomes interested
in helping you.
